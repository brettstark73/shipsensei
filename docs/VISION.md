# ShipSensei - Vision

**The Problem**: Non-technical founders can't ship products without expensive developers or limiting no-code tools.

**The Solution**: AI mentor that guides you from idea → launched product with zero technical knowledge.

**Why Now**: Vibe coding (Bolt, Lovable) proves AI can generate code. We add the missing piece: **strategic mentorship**.

## What Makes Us Different

**Competitors** (Bolt, Lovable, v0): Generate code, assume you know what to build
**ShipSensei**: Guides requirements → stack → build → launch. We're the mentor, not just the coder.

## Target User

**"Non-Technical Sarah"**

- Has great product ideas
- Can't code, overwhelmed by tech
- Needs to validate ideas before expensive hires
- Wants to ship MVPs in days, not months

## Success = Ship Fast

**30 days post-launch:**

- 1,000 signups
- 200 deployed projects
- 50% still live after 30 days

**90 days post-launch:**

- 10,000 users
- 10 paying customers
- $200 MRR

## Core Belief

The barrier to building software should be **having an idea**, not **knowing how to code**.

**Thursday**: Product Hunt launch
**Friday**: Hacker News Show HN

**Target**: 1,000 signups, 100 deployed projects

## Month 2-3: Iterate

**Focus**: Product-market fit validation

## What Comes After (6+ months)

**Only if PMF validated:**

- Marketplace (templates, components)
- Multiple tech stacks (beyond Next.js)
- Enterprise features (white-label, SLA)
- Educational content (courses, tutorials)

## Key Milestones

| Milestone      | Target Date | Success Metric             |
| -------------- | ----------- | -------------------------- |
| MVP Complete   | Week 4      | 1 person deploys in 30 min |
| Beta Program   | Week 6      | 5+ successful deployments  |
| Public Launch  | Week 9      | 1,000 signups              |
| First Revenue  | Week 12     | 10 paying customers        |
| PMF Validation | Month 6     | 100 customers, $2K MRR     |

## What If We Fail?

**Pivot triggers**:

- Week 6: <3 beta users deploy → Problem with UX
- Week 9: <500 signups → Problem with positioning
- Month 3: <5 paying customers → Problem with value prop

**Response**: User interviews, iterate or pivot

## Focus: Ship Fast, Learn Fast

**Not**: Perfect code, comprehensive features, all options
**Yes**: Working MVP, real users, fast iteration

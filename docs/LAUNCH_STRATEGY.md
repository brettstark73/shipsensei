# ShipSensei - Launch Strategy

**Version**: 1.0
**Last Updated**: 2025-11-19
**Target Launch Date**: Q1 2026 (3 months from now)

## Launch Philosophy

**Goals**:
1. **Visibility**: Get in front of target audience (indie hackers, non-technical founders)
2. **Validation**: Confirm product-market fit with real users
3. **Momentum**: Build initial user base + word-of-mouth
4. **Learning**: Gather feedback to improve product

**Principles**:
- Build in public (share progress, learnings, setbacks)
- Launch early and often (soft launches before big launch)
- Community-first (engage authentically, don't just promote)
- Provide value first (educational content, not sales pitches)

## Pre-Launch (Weeks 1-8)

### Phase 1: Build Foundation (Weeks 1-4)

**MVP Development**:
- [x] Requirements wizard (conversational)
- [x] Tech stack recommender
- [x] Project scaffolding
- [ ] Basic code generation (using templates initially)
- [ ] One-click deployment (Vercel integration)

**Landing Page** (shipsensei.dev):
- Hero: "Ship products without code - AI mentor guides you from idea to launch"
- Social proof: Tweets, testimonials (from beta users)
- Waitlist signup (email collection)
- FAQ section
- Pricing page (transparency)

**Content Creation**:
- Blog posts: "Vibe Coding for Non-Technical Founders" (SEO)
- Twitter threads: Share development progress
- YouTube: Screen recordings of building features (build in public)

**Community Building**:
- Create Discord server (invite beta users)
- Twitter presence: @shipsensei
- Engage in relevant communities (Indie Hackers, r/SideProject)

**Target**: 500 waitlist signups

---

### Phase 2: Beta Testing (Weeks 5-8)

**Private Beta**:
- Invite 20-30 beta users from waitlist
- Mix of: indie hackers, non-technical founders, junior developers
- Direct access: Discord channel, weekly calls
- Goal: Identify critical bugs, UX issues, missing features

**Feedback Collection**:
- User interviews (30-min calls, 10+ users)
- Analytics (PostHog): Track usage, drop-off points
- Surveys: "What's confusing? What's missing?"

**Iteration**:
- Fix critical bugs
- Improve onboarding (reduce time to first deploy)
- Add missing features (based on feedback)

**Content**:
- Blog: "Building ShipSensei: Lessons from Beta"
- Twitter: Share beta user success stories (with permission)
- Case studies: "How [User] Built and Launched [Product] in 2 Days"

**Target**: 80% beta user activation (create + deploy project)

---

## Launch Week (Week 9)

### Day 1: Soft Launch (Monday)

**Platforms**: Indie Hackers, r/SideProject

**Post Strategy**:
- Authentic, not salesy: "I built this to solve my own problem..."
- Demo: Short video showing idea → deployed project
- Ask for feedback: "What features would you want?"
- Engage: Respond to every comment within 1 hour

**Example Post** (Indie Hackers):
```
Title: "I Built an AI Mentor That Helps Non-Technical Founders Ship Products"

I spent the last 3 months building ShipSensei after watching countless non-technical friends struggle to validate their startup ideas.

The problem: No-code tools are too limited. Hiring developers is too expensive and risky for unvalidated ideas.

The solution: An AI mentor that guides you from idea → requirements → tech stack → code → deployment → launch.

[Demo video: 2 mins showing full flow]

What I learned building this:
- Non-technical users need more than code generation - they need strategic guidance
- Vibe coding is powerful, but without mentorship, users get lost
- Templates + AI customization = best of both worlds

I'd love your feedback! What features would make this actually useful for you?
```

**Goal**: 100+ signups, 20+ comments with feedback

---

### Day 2-3: Content & Engagement (Tuesday-Wednesday)

**Blog Post**: "Why Vibe Coding Needs Mentorship (and How ShipSensei Provides It)"

**Twitter Thread**:
```
1/ I just launched ShipSensei - an AI mentor for non-technical founders who want to ship products.

Here's why it's different from Bolt, Lovable, and other vibe coding tools 🧵

2/ Problem: Current vibe coding tools focus on code generation.

But beginners don't just need code. They need to know:
- What to build (requirements)
- How to build it (tech stack)
- If it's secure (best practices)
- How to launch (deployment, marketing)

3/ ShipSensei guides you through all of that...

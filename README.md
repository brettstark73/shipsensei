# ShipSensei

**Your AI mentor for building and launching products - from idea to production, with zero technical knowledge required.**

## Vision

ShipSensei democratizes software development by guiding complete beginners through the entire product journey: from initial idea to requirements, architecture, development, testing, deployment, and launch. Think of it as having an expert software mentor available 24/7 to help you ship real products.

## Problem

Non-technical founders, creators, and entrepreneurs have brilliant ideas but face massive barriers:
- Don't know where to start or what questions to ask
- Get overwhelmed by technology choices and technical jargon
- Struggle to translate vision into working software
- Need guidance on security, testing, deployment - but don't know these are even necessary
- Launch anxiety: "Is this ready? What am I missing?"

## Solution

ShipSensei provides **end-to-end mentorship** through an intelligent wizard that:
1. **Understands your idea** - Asks the right questions to refine requirements
2. **Makes technical decisions** - Recommends battle-tested tech stacks
3. **Guides development** - Vibe coding assistance with real-time feedback
4. **Ensures quality** - Automatic security, testing, and best practices
5. **Handles launch** - Landing pages, deployment, marketing guidance
